# gofetch

Another neofetch-type utility that isn't annoying to customize

## why

fastfetch is a bunch of hardcoded nonsense, not allowing me to print custom strings
or format as a table. Here, you can run any command and assign it to a value, and use
any custom string using Go's template strings.
